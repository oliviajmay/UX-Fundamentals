# The Design Process
## Discovery Phase - Medium
I haven't had much design discovery experience persay, but I have had experience with problem solving and figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and formulating objectives and goals to achieve an ultimate solution.
  * **Strengths** - Communicating with the stakeholder or client about the expectations and requirements

  * **Weaknesses** - Asking enough questions initially to fully understand the expectations and requirements of the client so that I won't need to clarify or verify a certain goal later in the project.
## Strategy Phase - Low
Next step would be to come up with a stategic plan on how to tackle the problem discovered previously. I have little experience with design strategy especially when it comes to studying research analysis, etc.
  * **Strengths** - Analyzing the research to find current trends and patterns to come up with a solid plan for the problem
  
  * **Weaknesses** - I am not familiar with certain deliverables and setting up the new research.
## Information Architecture Phase - Medium
I have had experience doing graphic design posters and creating the layout of the product so that the readability is easy for the viewer.
  * **Strengths** - Organizing the structure of the content so that it is user friendly.

  * **Weaknesses** - Testing the prototypes of wireframes so that they have met the goals of the client.
## Visual Design Phase - Medium
My experience comes from basic Photoshop design to create posters and signage - playing with different fonts and styles to create the ultimate product.
  * **Strengths** - Being detailed oriented so that the aesthetics of the product work well with the usability of the product
  
  * **Weaknesses** - Choosing one visual direction and not trying to do too many things at once
## Development Phase - Low
I have little coding knowledge. I know very basic HTML and CSS through previous beginner classes but never applied it to creating a product.
  * **Strengths** - Following guides to help me create the visual design and put it into effect through code. 
  
  * **Weaknesses** - I need to further my practice and knowledge of front end code.
## Launch Phase - Low
I have little experience launch a entire project that was well tested and well researched from start to finish.
  * **Strengths** - Fine tuning the last bit of the product to make sure that everything is correct for the launch.
  
  * **Weaknesses** - Double and triple checking everything is up to par.
